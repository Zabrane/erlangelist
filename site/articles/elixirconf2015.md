I'm very excited that my [talk on high-availability](http://www.elixirconf.eu/elixirconf2015/saa-juric) got accepted for the [first European Elixir conference](http://www.elixirconf.eu/).

For the past three years, I have been evangelizing Erlang and Elixir here in Croatia, at our local annual [WebCampZg](http://2014.webcampzg.org/) event. In addition, I invested a lot of effort writing the [book on Elixir](https://www.manning.com/books/elixir-in-action-second-edition?a_aid=sjuric) which is now in its final stages.

All this work has been motivated by my own positive experience using Erlang and Elixir in production. Some four years ago, I started using Erlang almost by chance, and it helped me immensely in building a long-polling based HTTP push server together with the supporting data provider system. The more I worked with Erlang, the more I got fascinated with how useful it is when it comes to building server-side systems. Ultimately, it became my tool of choice for development of complex backend systems that need to provide reliable service.

I reached for Elixir two years ago, when I started this blog, hoping it will help me showcase the magic behind Erlang to OO developers. I was really surprised with the level of maturity and integration with Erlang, even at that early stage. Pretty soon, I started introducing Elixir in production, and discovered it further boosts my productivity.

Two years later, Elixir 1.0 is out, the ecosystem is growing, and we have great libraries such as [Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org/) and [Ecto](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ecto), leveraging Elixir to further improve developer productivity.

Moreover, there's a lot of learning material available. In addition to excellent online [getting started guides](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html) and [reference](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/), there are [three](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030584.do) [published](https://pragprog.com/book/elixir/programming-elixir) [books](https://pragprog.com/book/cmelixir/metaprogramming-elixir), with [Elixir in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/elixir-in-action-second-edition?a_aid=sjuric) almost finished, and [two](http://www.exotpbook.com/) [more](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/elixir-cookbook) in the making. The present looks great, and the future is even more promising. These are exciting times, and a great chance to jump aboard and start using Elixir and Erlang.

So if you happen to be interested, [grab a ticket for ElixirConfEU](http://www.elixirconf.eu/#register) while it's available. Hope I'll see you there!

While I'm in the announcement mode, I'll also mention that we're starting a local FP group here in Zagreb, Croatia. Details about the introductory drinkup can be found [here](http://www.meetup.com/lambdazg/events/219980288/), so if you happen to live nearby, come and visit us for some functional chat.
